Little example how to import and access HIDAPI from Swift 3 in conjunction with the Griffin Power Mate controller and the Luxafor Flag (http://luxafor.nl).

This is a Swift 3 (and 4) port of https://github.com/kybernetyk/pm8

Dependencies:
    - Xcode 8+, Swift 3.1+
    - hidapi ( https://github.com/signal11/hidapi ) [brew install hidapi]


Build:
    Make sure hidapi/module.map points to the correct hidapi.h file on your system. It works for now (Nov 2016) with Homebrew hidapi. You might need to change it though.

    Don't forget to update the 'Other Linker Flags' build settings in Xcode. Make sure the path points to the correct location of hidapi libs on your system.

    If in doubt run:
        pkg-config hidapi --cflags
        pkg-config hidapi --libs


Run:
    - Griffin Power Mate: you need to quit the Griffin Power Mate companion app first. Otherwise the device will be busy and not accessible to us!
    - Luxafor Flag: you need to quit the Luxafor companion app first. Otherwise the device will behave unexpectedly
